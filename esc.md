1. General
	- Every time the presenters flirt, swap drinks with someone else in the room and take a big gulp of your new drink.
	- Finish your drink every time an act enters the stage in traditional costume.
	- Whenever an act does an awkward dance routine, stand up and copy it. The last person standing finishes their drink.
	- If a country attempts to make a political statement, drink 2 fingers.
	- Every time a song has "love" in its title, tell someone in the room that you love them while gazing into their eyes. If you get the giggles, finish your drink.
	- Whenever there's a lighting or sound delay, start drinking. Only stop when everything works again.
	- Whenever you see glitter, feathers or coloured confetti, drink 3 fingers.
	- Every time someone doesn't sing in English, attempt to sing along. As soon as you find yourself struggling, take a big gulp of your drink.
	- Whenever a presenter awkwardly performs a short stand up routine before delivering their country's scores, do a shot.
	- If a country gives 12 points to its neighbour, drink 2 fingers.
